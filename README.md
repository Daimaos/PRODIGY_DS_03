# ðŸ“ˆ Market Data Decision Tree Analysis

## Overview  
This project involves applying a Decision Tree model on a market dataset to analyze and predict outcomes based on various market features. The aim is to extract actionable insights by understanding the key drivers behind market behavior through interpretable machine learning.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset contains market-related information including customer demographics, campaign attributes, and response variables. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical encoding to make it suitable for modeling.

## Project Tasks  
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and preparing the dataset for modeling.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.  
- Decision Tree Modeling: Training, evaluating, and interpreting a Decision Tree classifier.  
- Visualization: Plotting the Decision Tree structure to understand decision paths and feature importance.
